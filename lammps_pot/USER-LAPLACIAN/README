What is lammps_user_laplacian
----------------------------
lammps_user_laplacian package consists of module "compute diagonalHessian" for LAMMPS
to calculate the diagonal elements of Hessian matrix 
(without summation, output is global vector with length N_atoms * 3).

This module is a modificationi (reduction) to the module "compute partialHessian" developed by Anthony B. Costa, 
anthony.costa@numericalsolutions.org. Refer to http://bitbucket.org/numericalsolutions/lammps-hessian.
WITH MODIFICATIONS BY S. Kadkhodaei and A. van de Wallei,
that calculates the Hessian matrix for a group of atoms during a LAMMPS simulation.

Add to LAMMPS
-------------
Take the following steps to add this package to you compilation of LAMMPS.

1- Add the folder USER-LAPLACIAN to the src/ directory of the latest version of LAMMPS. 
2- In the makefile add the user-laplacian in the USER's Package variables.
3- make yes-user-laplacian
4- make mpi  and/or   make mode=shlib mpi  
5- Add the path to the shared library:    

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/path_to_LAMMPS_source/lammps-XXXXX/src/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For a detailed instruction on how to add packages to lammps comiplation, refer to LAMMPS manual
https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_package.html

Command line options
--------------------
For the compute module
"compute ID group-ID diagonalHessian epsilon"
ID = user-assigned name for the computation
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to perform the computation on
diagonalHessian = style name for this command
epsilon = displacement value for the centeral finite difference method 


Output user-laplacian
----------------

the best practice is to collect partial hessian into a data structure in an external C program, 
in a coupled simulation where one run LAMMPS as a library. 
There are examples of how to do this in the examples/COUPLE directory of LAMMPS, for example, examples/COUPLE/simple/simple.c.
Please, see library.cpp to see example how to get global vector.
To build LAMMPS as a share library use the tag 
make mode=shlib mpi



The output data is a global VECTOR in the format with length N_atoms * 3 (independent on dimension of system):
1atom xx , yy, zz,
2atom xx, yy, zz etc


 
Future development
-----------------
Currently these module are designed for serial run. They still can be compiled with mpi but have to be executed on one core. Future improvement will design a parallel implementation.
