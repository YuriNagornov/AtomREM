!	CONTENT OF DIRECTORY												!
!	in EACH examlpe we put IN/ and OUT/ folders:									!
!	- IN/ AND OUT/ folders contain the input and output files for 1 simulation 					!
! 	- ARGON_7 contains the examples for different initial configurations and examples of reaction paths, 		!
!							PLEASE, see README_ARGON_7 in the ARGON_7 folder 		!
! 	- ARGON_13 contains two examples for argon cluster with 13 atoms for two reaction paths				!
!	- ARGON_38 contains two examples for argon cluster with 38 atoms for two reaction paths, 			! 
!			the SIMULATION_2 case has several stages, that is why it has continuous simulation and	 	!
!			example only for final stage. Whole reaction path is in the folder /PATH_WAY_38/		! 
!	- ARGON_CRYSTAL contains the example on hcp - fcc transformation in Lennard-Jones argon crystall, 		!
!			OUT/ folder has only reaction paths data, and OUT_ALL_DATA folder has all output files		!
!	- CYCLOBUTANE contains the example on cyclobutane molecule transformation through one saddle point 		!
!			to the several products										!
